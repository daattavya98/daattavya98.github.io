I am a PhD student at the Computer Lab in Cambridge, working on Mathematical Discovery with AI. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/team/dr-challenger-mishra/'> Dr. Challenger Mishra</a>. Previously, I did a masters in mathematical and theoretical physics at the University of Oxford with a focus on Calabi-Yau manifolds. 

I am interested in the nature of mathematical discovery and building tools for AI-guided discovery. I am also interested in applying these tools to specific applications and have previously worked in geometry, mathematical physics and number theory.
