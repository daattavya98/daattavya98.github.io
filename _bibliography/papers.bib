  abstract = {Quantum scrambling measured by out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has an important role in understanding the physics of black holes and evaluating quantum chaos. It is known that Rydberg atom has been a general interest due to its extremely favourable properties for building a quantum simulator. Fast and efficient quantum simulators can be developed by studying quantum scrambling in related systems. Here we present a general quantum circuit to theoretically implement an interferometric protocol which is a technique proposed to measure OTOC functions. We apply this circuit to measure OTOC and hence the quantum scrambling in a simulation of two spin Ising spin model for Rydberg atom. We apply this method to both initial product and entangled states to compare the scrambling of quantum information in both cases. Finally we discuss other constructions where this technique can be applied.},

  abstract = {We propose a machine learning approach to study topological quantities related to the Sasakian and $G_2$-geometries of contact Calabi-Yau $7$-manifolds. Specifically, we compute datasets for certain Sasakian Hodge numbers and for the Crowley-N\"ordstrom invariant of the natural $G_2$-structure of the $7$-dimensional link of a weighted projective Calabi-Yau $3$-fold hypersurface singularity, for 7549 of the 7555 possible $\mathbb{P}^4(\textbf{w})$ projective spaces. These topological quantities are then machine learnt with high performance scores, where learning the Sasakian Hodge numbers from the $\mathbb{P}^4(\textbf{w})$ weights alone, using both neural networks and a symbolic regressor which achieve $R^2$ scores of 0.969 and 0.993 respectively. Additionally, properties of the respective Gr\"obner bases are well-learnt, leading to a vast improvement in computation speeds which may be of independent interest. The data generation and analysis further induced novel conjectures to be raised.},

  abstract = {We study a generalisation of the quality of an ABC triple that we call the weighted average multiplicity (WAM), in which the logarithmic heights of prime factors are raised to a complex exponent s. The WAM is connected to the standard ABC conjecture at s=1. We show that for real part of s less than 1, WAM is unbounded over ABC triples both for integers and polynomials. For real part greater than 1, we characterise a boundary beyond which WAM is holomorphic and bounded. In this region, we show that WAM is related to the multiplicity of the largest prime factor of the triple, a quantity that we connect with the original ABC conjecture and whose distribution we explore computationally.},
